Chip was watching television.
The magic key was on the arm of the chair.
Nadim came to play.
Chip didn't want to play.
He wanted to watch television.
He wanted to watch the programme about magpies.
Nadim wanted a magic adventre.
Chip looked for the magic key, but he couldn't find it.
Nadim helped Chip to look.
Chip looked at the armchair.
"I puit the key on the arm f the chair," he said.
Suddenly, he had an idea.
The children looked int the arnchair.
They found lots of things.
Chip found Mum's missing ear-ring.
"Mum will be pleased," he said.
Chip found the key.
It was stuck to toffee.
"Yuk!" said Chip.
"It's all sticky."
Chip told Mum about the armchair.
He gave Mum the missing ear-ring.
Nadim cleaned the key.
He made it very shiny.
The children went into Biff's room.
Biff looked at the key.
"Oh no!" It looks very shiny," she said.
"I hope the magic still works."
Suddenly, the key began to glow.
It looked very bright.
The magic took the children into a new adventure.
The children were in a wood.
Chip didn't like it.
The wood ws dark and gloomy.
"Come on!" he said.
Suddenly, Biff saw something shiny.
She picked it up.
"What a beautiful ring!" she said.
"Somebody must have dropped it."
The children saw soldiers.
The soldiers saw the ring.
They grabbed the children.
"That ring is stolen," they said.
The soldiers took the children to the prince.
"We've found your thieves," they said.
"Here's your ring."
"Here ar ethe thieves," sid the prince.
"What else have they stolen?"
"My watch was stolen" said a man.
"My ear-ring was stolen," said a lady.
A soldier took the magic key.
"Look at this shiny key," he said.
"These children have stolen things.
They must have locked them away."
The soldiers took the children to a prison.
"Where are the stolen things?" they asked.
"Tell us, or we'll lock you up."
Suddenly, a magpie flew down.
It took the magic key.
"Stop that magpie!" called Biff.
It's stolen the key."
The magpie flew into the woods.
"The magpie is the theif," said Chip.
The children ran after the magpie.
Everyone ran after the children.
The magpie flew to a tree.
"Look in its nest," said Chip.
Nadim climbed the tree.
"Be careful," called Biff.
Nadim looked in the magpie's nest.
It was full of shiny things.
Nadim gasped.
"What beautiful things!" he said.
"You see!" said Anneena, crossly.
"We aren't the thieves. The magpie took your things."
"Sorry!" said the soldier.
"Magpies like shiny things," said Biff.
"So it was a good job Nadim made the magic key shiny, after all."
