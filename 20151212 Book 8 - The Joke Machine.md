Everyone was in the playground.
"I've got a good joke," said Wilf.
"What goes black, white, black, white?"
"I don;t know," said Biff.
"A penguin rolling down a hill!" said Wilf.
"Ive got one," said Anneena.
"Why couldn't the skeleton got to the party?"
"Why couldn't the skeleton go to the party?" asked Chip.
"It had no body to go with!" said Anneena.
"Time to come inside!" called Mrs May.
"Line up quietly, everyone."
"What do sea monsters eat?" said Nadim.
"Fish and ships!"
"That's a terrible joke!" said Biff.
"Get in, you chatterboxes," said Mrs May.
"Didn't you hear the whistle?"
"Sorry, Mrs May," said Wilf.
"We were telling jokes."
"Well, it's time to stop now," said Mrs May.
"Mrs May!" called Biff.
"What does an elephant do on a motorway?"
"Not now, Biff," said Mrs May.
"Tell me later. In you go everyone."
"Biff," whispered Nadim.
"What does an elephant do on a motorway?"
"About two miles an hour!" said Biff.
"Biff! Nadim!" said Mrs May.
"Go inside quietly!"
It was nearly time to go home.
"Well done!" said Mrs May.
"You have worked hard today.
Now it's time to tidy up."
"Mrs May!" called Anneena.
"Do you want to hear one of Nadim's jokes?"
"Well, just one," said Mrs May.
"I want to get home tonight."
"Why do cows wear bells?" asked Anneena.
"I don't know," said Mrs May.
"Why do cows wear bells?"
"Because their horns don't work!" said Nadim.
Mrs May clapped her hands.
"I want to ask you something," she said.
"Who knows about Help the Children Day?"
"There's a special day," said Chip.
"People raise money to help children," said Wilf.
"How could we raise money for Help the Children Day?" asked Mrs May.
"We'll have to think hard," said Anneena.
"Tell me your ideas tomorrow," said Mrs May.
Everyone was at Biff and Chip's house.
"I can't think of anything," said Chip.
"Nor can I," said Anneena.
"What ideas have we had so far?" asked Biff.
"Read out the list, Nadim."
Nadim read out the list.
"Ideas for Help the Children. Washing cars, toy sale."
"That's only two ideas!" said Anneena.
"Well, we've only had two ideas," said Wilf.
"I don't think washing cars is a good idea," said Chip.
"I don;t think Mrs May would let us."
"And I gave all my old toys to the last toy sale," said Wilf.
Then Nadim had a good idea.
"What about a joke machine?" he said.
He told them all about his idea.
Everyone was excited.
"I can't wait to tell Mrs May," said Chip.
The next day, they were back at school.
"Mrs May!" called Anneena.
"We've got an idea for Help the Children!"
"It must be a good one," said Mrs May.
"You all sound very excited."
They told Mrs May what the idea was.
"It's a joke machine!" said Biff.
"We write jokes on slips of paper," said Chip.
"Then we put the jokes in a box."
"The box is the joke machine," said Wilf.
"It's a great idea!" said Anneena.
"People pay for a joke!"
"They give some money," said Wilf.
"Then they get a joke from the box."
"I think it's a lovely idea," said Mrs May.
"But I can see one problem."
"What's that?" everyone asked.
"You will need lots and lots of jokes," said Mrs May.
The joke machine was finished.
"It's brilliant!" said Chip.
"Look! I've finished the poster,"
"A laugh does you good," read Wilf.
"Do good with a laugh."
"We have the jokes on the computer, now we can print them off," said Nadim.
"And here's the next one: What game do horses play?"
"Stable tennis!" laughed Anneena.
"How many jokes have we got?" asked Wilf.
"Forty-nine," said Nadim.
"I wish we had some more."
"Here is one for you," said Mrs May.
"What can fly and has four legs?"
"We don't know!" they all said.
"What can fly and has four legs?"
"Two birds!" said Mrs May.
Everyone laughed.
They took the joke machine to the shopping centre.
"Roll up! Roll up!" they shouted.
"Support the children! Buy a joke for not less than 50p!"
A man came to buy a joke.
"He's given us a pound!" called Chip.
"Thank you, very much."
The man wanted them all to tell the joke.
So they told it together.
"What has only one foot?" they all said.
"I don't know," said the man.
"What has only one foot?"
"A leg!" they said.
Everyone laughed.
"I have some good news," said Mrs May.
"The mayor loves your joke machine.
She wants to buy all your jokes!
Guess how much she will pay for each one?"
"We don't know," said everyone.
"How much will she pay for each one."
"Two pounds!" said Mrs May.
"Fifty jokes at two pounds each!" said Nadim.
"That's a hundred pounds!"
"But we've sold twenty jokes," said Wilf.
"There are only thirty left."
"I've been putting them back," said Nadim.
"There are still fifty in there."
"Three cheers for Nadim!" said Anneena.
"It was his brilliant idea!"
"And three cheers for the joke machine!" said Mrs May.
"I;ve thought of another joke," said Nadim.
"What card game do crocodiles like?"
"We don't know," they all said.
"What card game do crocodiles like?"
"Snap!" said Nadim.
They all groaned.
