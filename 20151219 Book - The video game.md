Susie had a video game.
She pressed the start button.
A little man cam on to the screen.
He waved.
Susie pressed the A button anf the little man jumped.
Susie pressed the B button and he ran.
Susie pressed all the buttons.
She pressed them again and again and the little man ran and jumped.
He went up a mountain and went swinging though the trees.
The, suddenly he fell down into a cave where there were lots of monsters.
"Help!" said a voice.
Susie looked round.
There was nobody there.
"Help me, Susie!" said the voice again.
Susie looked back at the screen.
The voice was coming from the little man.
"Get me out of here!" he cried.
"Please get me out of here!"
Susie pressed the buttons but the monsters were still there,
She pressed them again but she couldn;t make them go away.
Suddenly she stopped.
"How can you talk?" she said to the little man.
"You are just a video game!"
"Help!" he cried.
"Please help or the monsters will eat me up!"
"If they eat you up, you can always have another life in a video game," said Susie.
"No!" said the little man.
"I have got one life just like you. Help! Help!"
Susie pressed the buttons again but the monsters were still there.
They looked very hungry.
"Oh dear! I don't know how to help you!" said Susie.
"I have pressed all the buttons but they don't work!"
She stopped and thought.
"Perhaps if I switch the game off the monsters will go away."
Susie  pressed the OFF button but the monsters were still there.
"Help!" cried the little mand again.
Susie turned the video game machine over and took out the batteries.
When she looked at the screen againthe monster were still there.
"Quick!" cired the little man.
"How can I help you? Tell me how to help you!" cried Susie.
"Just give me your hand," said the little man.
Susie put out her hand and touched the screen.
Suddenly, there was the little man in her hand.
He was very small.
"Oh, thank you, Susie," he said.
"You have saved my life!"
Susie smiled.
Just then there was a big bang from the video game machine.
Susie looked at the screen.
It had gone grey.
"Look!" she said tot he little man.
"The monsters have gone."
But when she looked down, her hand was empty.
