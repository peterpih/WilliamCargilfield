Chip and Wilf were tracking Dad.
"This is a good game," said Wilf.
"Put this in your hat," said Chip.
"Dad won't see us.
Then we can track him."
Chip and Wilf hid in the trees.
"Keep down," said Chip,
"Here comes Dad."
Dad went past.
He looked for the boys, but couldn't wee them.
Floppy went sniff, sniff, sniff!
"Go away, Floppy!" said Chip, but Floppy wouldn't go.
Chip and Wilf went home.
They looked for Biff but she was not there.
The key began to glow.
It took Chip and Wilf into a magic adventure.
The magic took them to Africa.
Some zebra were going to drink at the pool.
Chip and Wilf looked around.
"A herd of zebra!" said Wilf.
"Don't let them see us!"
Chip saw a lorry by the tree.
Some men got out.
The began to creepup to the zebra.
"What do they want?" said Wilf.
"oh no!" said Wilf.
"They are going to catch a zebra."
"We must stop them," said Chip.
He had an idea.
"Come on," he said.
The boys ran to the lorry.
Chip pressed the horn.
"Beeeeeeeep!" it went.
"Beeeeeeeep!" went the horn again.
The zebra looked up.
The horn scared the zebra.
They ran away.
The men were scared, too.
They ran back to the lorry.
"Quick! Let's go," one called.
"Quick, Wilf," said Chip.
"Run!"
Tehy ran away.
Chip and Wilf hid in a buch.
They didn't want the men to see them.
The men couldn't start the lorry.
Suddenly a jeep drove up.
There were rangers in the jeep.
The men jumped out of the lorry and ran away.
The rangers chased after them.
A ranger shook Chip's hand.
"Thank you," he said.
"You saved a zebra."
The magic key began to glow.
It was time to go.
It had been an exciting adventure.
"Why didn't the lorry start?" asked Wilf.
"Ha! I took the key!" said Chip.
