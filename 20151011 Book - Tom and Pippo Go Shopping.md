Today Mummy and I went shopping.
I took Pippo.
Pippo likes to go to the shops.
I said he would love a little piece of bread.
But I ate it.
I said Pippo wuld love a ripe, juicy plum.
But I ate it.
Pippo wanted just a little piece of cheese from the cheese counter.
But I ate it.
WHen we had bought all the shopping.
Mummy gave me the money and said I could pay.
Mummy had a cupof tea and I had a litle drink.
But there wasn't enough for Pippo.
Anyway, I'll give Pippo some tea when we get home.
