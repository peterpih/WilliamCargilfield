There once was an old woman who lived in a vinegar bottle.
She was very unhappy.
"Dear me!" she cried.
"How tired I am of living in this vinegar bottle!
If only I lived in a little cottage in the country with a cow to give me milk.
Then I would be happy!"
Just then, a fairy was flying by.
She heard what the old woman said.
"I will make your wish come true," she smiled and waved her wand.
At once the old woman found herself. in a dear little cottage.
There was a brown cow outside eating grass.
"Thank you, fairy," said the old woman.
"Now I shall be happy."
A week later, the fairy went to see the old woman.
"Oh fairy!" she cried.
"How unhappy I am living here all alone!
If only I lived in a house in the city where I could meet lots of people.
Then I would be happy!"
"Very well, I will make your wish come true," said the fairy and she waved her wand.
At once the old woman found herself in a fine house in the city.
There were lots of people going up and down the street.
"Thank you, fairy." said the old woman.
"Now I shall be happy."
A week later, the fairy went to see the old woman.
"Oh fairy!" she cried.
"How unhappy I am!
The city is so noisy.
If only I lived in a quiet house by the sea.
Then I would be happy!"
"Very well, I will make your wich come true," said the fairy and shw waved her wand.
At once the old woman found herself in a quiet house by the sea.
"Thank you, fairy" said the old woman.
"Now I shall be happy."
A week later, the fairy went to see the old woman.
"Oh fairy!" she cried.
"How unhappy I am!
This house is too small for me.
If only I lived in a fine palace up on a hill.
Than I would be happy!"
"Very well, I will make your wish come true," said the fairy and she waved her wand.
At once the old woman found herself in a beautiful palace high up on top of a hill.
"Thank you, fairy," said the old woman.
"Now I'm sure I shall be happy."
A week later, the fairy went to see the old woman.
"Oh fairy!" she cried.
"How unhappy I am!
This palace is too big for me to live in."
Before she could say another word, the fairy waved her wand.
At once, the old woman found herself back in the vinegar bottle.
"Nothing I do can make you happy," said the fairy, "so there you must stay."
And she flew away to her own little home in the forest.
