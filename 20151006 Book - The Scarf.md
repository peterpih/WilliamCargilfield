Anneena liked knitting.
She made a scarf.
Anneena's mum helped her.
The scarf was long and warm.
"It's a good scarf", said Anneena.
Biff and Chip came out to play.
It was a cold day.
Anneena put on her scarf.
"What a cold day!" she said.
Biff looked at Anneena's scarf.
"What a long scarf!" she said.
"I made it," said Annena.
"I couldn't stop knitting."
The children went to the park.
They went to the pand.
The pond was frozen.
It had ice on it.
Some children ran up.
They pulled on Aneena's scarf.
"Stop it!" shouted Anneena.
"Stop it!" shouted Anneena's mum.
A boy went on the ice.
The ice was dangerous.
"Get off," shouted Anneena's mum.
"The ice is not safe,"
Anneena's mum couldn't get the boy.
She couldn't go on the ice.
Everyone was frightened.
"Help!" shouted the boy.
Anneena had a good idea.
She took off her scarf.
"Make a rope," she said.
Anneena's mum made a rope.
She made it out of scarves and coats.
She threw it to the boy.
Everyone pulled the rope.
They pulled the boy out of the pond.
The boy was safe.
"Hooray!" shouted Anneena.
"I am sorry!" said the boy.
"Thank you."
"Ice is dangerous," said Anneena.
Anneena looked at her scarf.
"I'm glad I made it long," she said.
