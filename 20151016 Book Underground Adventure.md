The children were in the cellar.
They wanted to find a secret tunnel.
The children looked everywhere.
They tapped on the floor.
They tapped on the walls.
But there was no secret tunnel.
"It's no good," said Biff.
Kipper ran into the cellar.
He had the magic key.
The key was glowing.
They ran to Biff's bedroom.
"Come on!" called Kipper.
"It's time for a magic adventure."
They magic took them underground.
They were in a big tunnel.
Wilma picked up a lap.
"Come on," she said,
"Let's go!"
There were elves in the tunnel.
But they were shy.
"Oh no!" they said.
"Children!"
The children went down the tunnel.
They didn't see the elves.
"This way," said Wilma.
The cave had an echo.
"Whoooooaa!" called Kipper.
"Whoooooaa!" went the echo.
"Whoooooaa!" went Kipper.
The elves laughed.
They laughed and laughed.
The elves came out.
They ran to say hello.
"Whoooooa!" they went.
"Whoooooaa!" went the echo.
And everyone laughed.
The elves were sad.
They had no work.
"Can you help?" said the elves.
"Our gold has run out. We don't know what to do."
Wilma had a good idea.
She told the elves what it was.
The elves liked Wilma's idea.
They painted some signs.
The children helped.
The elves put lights in the caves.
The cave looked beautiful.
People came to see them.
The elves were happy.
"What an adventure!" said WIlf.
"I have a good idea," said Chip.
"What do you think?"
