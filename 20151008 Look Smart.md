"Put it on," said Mum.
"I want you to look smart."
"Come here, Chip," said Mum.

"I know," said Chip.
"You want me to look smart."
Dad came in with a try.
He fell over a bag.
A cup fell over.
Some chocolate went over Kipper's top.
"Oh no!" said Kipper.
"Chocolate all over my top."

She sat on Mum's lipstick.
"Oh no!" said Biff.
"Lipstick on my dress."
Floppy ran in with muddy paws.
He jumped up at Chip.
"Oh Floppy!" said Chip.
"Mud all over my shirt."
"I can put on my old top," said Kipper.
"No," said Mum.
"I want you all to look smart."
"Smart clothes," said Mum.
"Put them on."
The children put them on.
