Did you ever hear about Sal and Tom's baby brither?
His name was Joe.
They called him little Joe.
And little Joe was always into big trouble.
One day his dad was doing the washing.
Tome was helping.
Joe was not helping.
He was not helping at all.
"Here's a book," said Sal.
"Why don't you look at the book, Joe."
"Book!" said Joe., and he smiled a big smile.
(Oh Oh!)
But do you think he looked at the book?
Oh no.
Not little Joe.
As soon as no one was looking at him, he put the book in the washing machine.
Then his dad put in some more washing.
He shut the door and put the machine on.
Round and round went the book in the machine, round and round until it was so wet it fell to bits.
Then the machine stopped.
It wouldn;t go.
And all because of Joe.
That was big trouble.
It took Dad and Sal and Tom a long time to fix the washing machine.
"All gone book." said Joe.
After that, they went out to do the chopping.
On the way home Dad took out the keys for the door.
Joe saw them.
"Key!" said Joe.
"Key key key key!"
He shouted and shouted.
"I think he wants to play with the keys, Dad," said Sal.
"I know. I know! And all right , Joe," said Dad.
"Just stop that noise.
Now here are the keys.
You can play with them but do look after them."
"Key!" said Joe, and he smiled a big smile.
(Oh Oh!)
Well, do you think he looked after the keys?
Oh no.
Not little Joe.
As soon as no one was looking at him, he put the keys in the dustbin!
So now how were they going to get in?
Dad put the shopping bag down by the door.
"Can we have the keys please, Joe?" he said.
Joe smiled.
"Oh no!" said Sal and Tom.
"Where are the keys, Joe?"
But all Joe said was, "Keys. All gone."
They looked and looked.
They looked everywhere but they couldn't find the keys.
So they had to go all the way to their friends in the next street to get some other keys.
By the time they got home again they were all very tired and hungry.
Little Joe was very, very tired.
"Here's a sandwich, Joe," said Dad.
"You go and eat the sandwich while we make tea."
"Mmm," said Joe, and he smiled a tired smile.
(Oh Oh!)
But did he eat the sandwich, do you think?
Oh no.
Not little Joe.
As soon as no one was looking at him, he went and put the sandwich in the video machine!
And that was big trouble.
Big BIG trouble!
But by thte time the others found out, little Joe was fast asleep.
No trouble at all.
