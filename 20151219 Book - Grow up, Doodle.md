"When I grow up," said Doodle, "I shall be a grasshopper."
"A grasshopper?" said his mother.
"You wont.
You'll be a frog.
Like me.
Like all of us.
Like your brothers."
"But why?" said Doodle.
"Why not a grasshopper?
Jus tthink of it.
I could jump and hop in the long grass --"
"You can jump and hop when you are a frog," said his mother.
"Now swim along and have your tea."
Doode cam back again at once.
"I know!" he said.
"I'll be a bird! Just think of it! I could fly from tree to tree --"
"If you try to fly from tree to tree, said his mother, "you'll come down to earth in no time.
Frogs jump and hop; they don;t fly.
Now, go and sleep."
But as Doodle tries to sleep, he thought of all the other that he could be.
A rabbit?
He could hop all over the park.
A squirrel?
That would be fun, up in the trees.
"I'm tired of being just a small tadpole," he tought.
All tadpoles are small, and Doodle was very, vey small.
All his brothers were very big tadpoles.
When their mother called them, they always got there first.
When Doodle came up, they let him eat what they didn;t want.
He was small and unhappy and always hungry.\"When I grow up I shall be something big, like an elephant," he said.
"You'll be a frog," said his mother.
"You'll be a frog -- and like it!"
You'll be a frog -- and like it!" said his brothers.
"but just as little on. Not like us."
And off they went to find more to eat.
They were always eting now, and were very, very big.
As time went by, they got very big-headed about it.
Doodle looked at them.
"All head and no tail," he thought.
"I can't help being small."
The he noticed something.
His big-headed brothers had got legs!
Little baby legs!
"It's not fair!" he shouted.
"I'm the one who wants to do something exciting.
I'm the one who wants to be a grasshopper.
Or a rabbit.
Or a squirrel.
It's not fair!"
His brothers smiled all over their big heads, and went on eating.
They waved their little baby legs and looked for more to eat.
Doodle went off on his own.
He would forget ll about his big-headed brithers.
He would grow up how he liked -- on his own.
For the first time ever, he could eat all he wanted.
His mother came to see him and noticed him get as fat and as big-headed as his brothers.
"You'll be a frog any day now," she said.
"You'll be a frog -- and like it!"
But Doodle shook his big head and waved his little legs.
"I'm going to be a grasshopper," he said.
He never noticed his borhters jum out of the water.
He never noticed that they now looked just like their mother.
He just noticed that his back legs had started to grow and that his tail had gone small.
"With legs like these, I'll be a grasshopper in no time," he thought, and he wanted to see what would grow next.
But there was nothing more.
Perhaps he was a squirrel after all?
No -- not with this little baby tail.
A rabbit then?
Well, no, not a rabbit.
He jumped up out of the river.
The greass and the cold wet mud all around him were loveley.
With one long hop, he set off to find his brothers.
He was a frog -- and he liked it!
