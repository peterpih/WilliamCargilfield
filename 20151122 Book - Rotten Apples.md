Biff wanted to help Mum, so Mum gave her a job.
"Pick up the apples so I can cut the grass," said Mum.
Biff picked up an apple.
"Yuk!" she said.
"Some of the apples are bad."
She didn't pick up the rotten ones.
Mum made Biff pick up all the rotten apples.
"Put them in the box," said Mum.
"This is a rotten job," said Biff.
Biff put the box of apples by the dustbin.
"Yuk! Rotten apples!" she said.
Kipper was excited.
"Come and see this!" he said.
"What is it?" asked Biff.
"Come and see," said Kipper.
A man with a horse and cart came down the street.
The man stopped outside the house.
"It's Harry Smith," said Chip.
Everyone liked Harry Smith.
He made people laugh.
He wore a top hat and a red coat.
He sold things from his cart.
Harry Smith rang a bell.
"Come and see!" he said.
"I've got some birds going cheap."
Biff and Chip laughed.
Mum bought some logs.
The logs were heavy.
Harry Smith helped Mum to carry them.
Biff looked at the horse.
"Can we give the horse an apple?" she asked.
"Yes," said Harry Smith.
Biff picked up an apple.
She held it out.
The horse took it with its big teeth.
The horse saw the box of apples.
It began to eat them.
"Oh no!" said Biff.
"It's eating all the bad ones."
Buff told Harry Smith about the horse.
Harry laughed.
"I didn't know she liked rotten apples," he said.
Biff looked at the box.
It was empty.
All the apples were gone.
"What a greedy horse!" said Biff.
The children wanted a ride.
"Jump up!" called Harry Smith.
The children climbed on the cart.
"Hold on!" said Harry.
The horse began to run.
Harry Smith pulled the reins.
"Show down!" he shouted.
But the horse went faster and faster.
The horse ran down the street.
"Slow down!" shouted Harry Smith.
"Stop!" shouted Mum.
"Help!" shouted the children.
The horse wouldn't stop.
It ran and ran.
Mum ran after it.
Harry Smith pulled the reins.
It ran into a car park.
"Look out," shouted Harry Smith.
The horse began to sway.
It made a funny noise.
The horse went slower and slower.
Suddenly, it stopped.
Then it sat down and went to sleep.
Harry Smith and the children climbed off the cart.
"The horse is drunk," said Mum.
"Why is it drunk?" asked Biff.
Harry Smith looked at the horse.
"The rotten apples made the horse drunk," he said.
Biff was sorry.
Harry Smith laughed.
He didn't mind.
People came to see the horse.
They bought things from the cart.
Harry Smith sold everything.
He gave the children a present.
"Biff's rotten apples did me a good turn," he said.
