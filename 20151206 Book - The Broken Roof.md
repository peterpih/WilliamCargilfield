It was game time t school.
The children were outside in the field.
Anneena ran up to Mrs May.
"Come and see something, Mr May," she said.
Someone had broken the fence down and dumoed junk on the field.
Wilf was cross.
"We don't want junk on our field," he said.
"The field isn;t a dump," said Mrs May.
The Mrs May saw something inthe junk.
"Do you see this?" she asked the children.
"It's a mangle. It gets water out of wet clothes."
"How does it do that?" asked Anneena.
Mrs May took the mangle into the classroom.
She showed the children how it worked.
Frst she got a big sheet and made it wet.
Then Nadim turned the handle and Biff helped Mrs May put the sheet through.
The water ran out fo the sheet and went into the bucket.
"We dont use mangles now to get clothes dry," said Mrs May.
"What do we use?"
Mrs May showed the children a picture of someone washing clothes a long time ago.
Mrs May asked the children if they had any old things at home.
Some of the children said they had.
When Biff and Chip got home from school they looked at the little house.
"The house looks very old," said Chip, "and so do these little children. Let's take them to school."
