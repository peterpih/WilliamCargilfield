A boy was sitting on a rock on a hill.
His sheep were eating grass.
"Why do I have to sit here and watchthe sheep all day?" he asked.
"It is no fun out here alone."
The boy saw two men coming up the hill.
He wanted to have some fun.
"Help! Help! he shouted.
"A wolf is going to eat my sheep!"
"Where is the wolf?" asked the first man.
"Which way did he go?"
"Follow me, said the boy, and the men did.
They went tothe top of the hill.
"I see many sheep, but where is the wolf?" asked the second man.
"There is no wolf. I played a trick on you," said the boy and he laughed.
The men were angry with the boy, and they went away.
But the boy thought it was fun.
He wanted to play the trick again, so he ran after the men.
"Help me! Help me!" he shouted.
"A big wolf is hiding by that tree!
This is no trick!
The wolf is coing to eat my sheep!"
"Maybe there is a wolf this time," said the man to his friend.
They went up the hill again, but there was not wolf.
"You tricked us again," said the men.
"But this is the last time.
We are going, and we will not come back."
The men walked down the hill again.
The boy was alone again.
"That was great fun," he said, and he laughed.
"I think I will sit down for a rest."
Just then, a wolf came over the hill.
"My, what beautiful white sheep," said the wolf.
"They look good to eat!"
The boy jumped up.
"No!" he shouted.
"You can't eat my sheep!"
"The men have gone," said the wolf.
"There is no one here to stop me.
Which one will be first?"
The boy ran to the top of the hill.
"Help!" he shouted.
"Please help me.
The wolf has come, and he is going to eat my beautiful sheep!"
The mean said, "That boy is playing tricks again.
We know there is no wolf"
"Please come!" said the boy.
"This time there is a wolf!"
"You see?" said the wolf.
"No one will help you. That's what you get for playing tricks!"
