Every week Mrs May took some of the children to the swimming pool.
The children were good swimmers and they liked going with Mrs May.
The children were taking a swimming test.
"It's time to begin," said Mrs May.
"Who wants to go first?"
"We do," sadi Ndim.
Biff, Chip, Wilma, and Nadim jumped into the pool.
The water was warm.
"Off you go," said Mrs May.
They had to swimm up and down the pool.
They had to swim ten lengths.
Wilma was first to swim ten lengths and Biff and Nadim were next.
It was hard for Chip to swim the ten lengths.
"Come on, Chip," called Mrs May.
"Don't stop. This is the last length."
So chip went on and everyone was pleased.
Next they had to swim to the bottom of the pool
They had to pick up a brick and swim with it to the top.
All the children passed the swimming test.
Mrs May was very pleased.
"Well done, everyone," she said.
The children were pleased too.
Biff and Chip told Mum and Dad about the swimming test.
"We passed," they said.
Mum and Dad were very pleased too.
Mum and Dad had a surprise for them.
Buff and Chip couldn't see what the surprise was.
"What is it?" asked Biff.
"It's a fish tank," said Biff.
"What a lovely surprise!"
Everyone looked at the fish swimming about the tank.
"There is room for more fish," said Dad.
"We can get some next time we go shopping."
The next day they went shopping.
Dad took them to a shop that sold fish.
"What a lovely shop!" said Biff.
"Look at all the fish."
There were big fish and little fish.
Kipper liked the big fish in a tank.
"Don't tap the glass," said Dad.
"The fish don't like it."
Dad put some more fish in the tank.
He put rocks on the bottom.
Next to the rocks he put a ship and a little box.
Wilma and Nadim came to see the fish tank.
"It looks lovely," said WIlma.
"I wish I could swim in there."
They went to play in Biff's room.
Chip ran in with the magic key.
The key was glowing.
"It's time for an adventure," said Biff.
The magic began to work.
It took the children into a new adventure.
This time it was a different sort of adventure.
The magic took them underwater.
The children had masks and flippers and tanks of air.
The could swim underwater.
The children had never seen so many fish.
They were all different colours.
"This is better than the pool," thought Chip.
"I feel like a fish," thought Wilma.
The children loved swimming under the water.
It was lovely to see all the fish and to swim with them.
Chip and Nadim swam to the bottom and picked up a big shell.
Biff looked at a jellyfish but she didn't swim too close.
They saw a ship under the water.
It was an old ship that had been under water for a long time.
They swam up to the ship.
Wilma didnt want to swim too close to it.
It looked dangerous.
They saw an octopus.
Oh no!
It ws sitting on a chest.
They couldn't look inside the chest with an octopus sitting on the lid.
They blew bubbles at the octopus.
The octopus didn't like bubbles so it swam away.
"Good!" thought he children.
"Now we can look inside."
The children opened up the chest and looked inside.
It was a treasure chest and it was full of gold.
Biff and Wilma pushed the chest over and all the gold fell out.
Nadim picked up a necklace and Biff picked up a gold cup.
Biff and Nadim were busy looking at the treasure.
They didn't see what Chip and Wilma saw.
A shark was coming.
Chip amd Wilma couldn't tell Biff and Nadim.
They pulled away and pointed at the shark.
The children were frightened.
They swam and swam but the shark swam after them.
Then the magic key began to glow.
The magic key took them out of the adventure.
"Wow! What an adventure!" said Biff.
"The treasure chest was like the one in our fish tank."
The children ran to look in the fish tank.
"Look, there's the treasure," said Chip.
"How did it get there?" asked Nadim.
"It's magic!" said Biff.
