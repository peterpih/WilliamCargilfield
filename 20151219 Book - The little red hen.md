There once was a littel red hen.
She lived in a cottage int he forest.
Every monring she tooka brush and swept her little house until it was clean and bright.
Chen her work was done, the little red hen took her basket and went out to get sticks for her fire.
One day, a fox cam walking through the forest.
He saw the little red hen's cottage.
He looked through the window and saw that the house was empty.
He thought he would try to catch the little red hen when she came home so he went and his behind a tree.
After a while he saw the little red hen coming along the forest path with her basket of sticks.
When the little red hen came near, the fox jumped out from behind the tree.
The little red hen was very frightened but quickly she flew up into a tree where the fox couldn't get her.
Now the fow was angry, but he thought of a clever way to get the little red hen down from the tree.
He began to chase his tail!
Round and round and round he wnet.
The little red hen looked down at the fox going round and round.
She began to feel dizzy, and before long, she felt so dizzy ythat she fell down from the tree.
Now the fox could ctach her, but when he tried to run over to her, he felt dizzy too and fell over.
The little red hen jumped up and ran into her cottage.
She shut the dorr with a bang.
So the fox didn't catch the little red hen after all.
