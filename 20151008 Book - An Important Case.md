The children were outside.
They were playing football.
Wilf kicked the ball.
It landed in a bush.
"Sorry," said Wilf.
Wilf couldn't get the ball.
"I can get it," said Kipper.
Kipper found a case.
"Look at this," he said.
"I found it in the bush."
Dad looked at the case.
He couldn't open it.
Wilf looked at the case.
"What can be in it?" he asked.
"It looks important."
"What is it?" asked Wilma.
"I don;t know," said Chip, "but it looks very important."
"What is in the case?" asked Kipper.
"I don't know," said Biff, "but it looks very, very, important."
"What is in the case?" asked Dad.
"We don;t know," said the police officer, "but it is very important."
A man came in a big car.
"Who is he?" asked Kipper.
"I don't know," said Dad, "but he look important."
The man took the case.
"It's my case," he said.
"Thank you. It was stolen. It is very important."
The man got in the car.
"Excuse me," said Wilma.
"What is in the case?"
"Ah!" said the man.
"My sandwiches."
