The Wind was very strong.
He was the North Wind, and he could blow across the hills anf across the sea.
He could make a storm blow up and he could make brave men frightened.
The Sun was very strong.
She was the mighty Sun, and she could shine in the sky all day.
Shw could make the trees green and she could make the rivers laugh.
"I'm stronger than you," said the North Wind.
He blew a big strong wind.
It whistled through space and blew an old woman into a fence.
"I;m stronger than you, little Sun."
"Is that what you think, North Wind?" said the Sun.
"You think you are as strong as the mighty Sun? We shall see about that."
She looked down from the sky.
"Do you see a man," she said, "walking along the road?"
"Yes," said the North Wind.
"I see him"
"Now we'll find out who's stronger," said the Sun.
"If you can make that man take his coat off, you will win.
But if I can make him take his coat off, I shall win.
I shall be stronger that you."
The North Wind laughed.
"Oh, little Sun," he said.
"What sort of competition is that?
I chall blow the man;s coat off in a second."
The Sun smiled.
"Why don't you have first try, then North Wind?
Let me see what you can do."
"Very well," said the North Wind.
"Keep back, everyone.
Give me space to blow."
And so the North Wind began to blow.
He blew as he had never blown before.
He blew and blew and blew.
The man ont he road looked up.
What a terrible wind!
He pulled his coat right round him.
"I'll blow that coat offFFFFF," shouted the North Wind.
He called up a terrible storm of rain and snow.
"I'll blow it right offFFFFF..."
But the man only pulled his coat tighter and tighter around him.
"You need a rest, North Wind," said the Sun.
"You must be tired.
Now it is time for me to try."
And so the North Wind stopped.
The rain and the snow stopped.
And the Sun came out.
The man looked up.
"How good the sun feels after the storm," he said.
"How good it feels on my back."
The Sun said nothing.
She just shone.
She shone and shone and shone.
"It feels so good," said the man.
And in no time at all, he stopped and took off his coat.
The Sun and the North Wind looked at the man, walking along the road with his coat in his hand.
"How happy he looks," said the Sun.
She smiled at the North Wind.
"You are very strong, North Wind, she said.
"But to blow and blow on people is not a good way to make them do what you want."
"No," said the North Wind.
"I see that now.
And I see now, oh mighty Sun, which of us is stronger."
