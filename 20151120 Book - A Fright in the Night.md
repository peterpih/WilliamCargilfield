Biff and Chip went to stay with Gran.
They ewent to stay for a week.
"Bee good," called Mum.
"Don;t worry," said Gran.
"I will."
Gran's house was small.
It has two bedrooms.
Biff and Chip had to sleep in the same bedroom.
Biff wanted the bed by the door.
Chip wanted the bed by the window.
"That's good," said Gran.
Gran took Biff ans Chip for a walk.
They went to the woods.
Biff saw some blackberries.
She wanted to pick some.
Gran had some plastic bags.
She gave one to Biff and Chip.
"We can make some blackberry jam," she said.
Gran made the blackberry jam.
Biff and Chip helped.
Chip made some labels and Biff licked the spoon.
They made nine jars of jam.
"You can take a jar home for Kipper." said Gran.
"And a jar for Wilf and Wilma."
The children loved Gran's house.
It was very old.
It had a big fireplace.
Buff helped Gran light the fire.
Chip helped Gran get some logs.
"Do yiou have ghosts?" he asked.
Gran Lughed.
"There a re no such things," she said.
They sat by the fire.
Gran made some toast.
Biff wanted to try the new jam.
"It;s still too hot," said Gran.
Chip had a new game.
It was called Haunted House.
"Can we play Haunted House, before we go to bed?" he asked.
It was time for bed.
Gran got Chip  hot water bottle.
"Is thid house haunted?" asked Biff.
"Don't worry," laughed Gran.
"I don't have ghosts in my house.
There are not such things."
Biff and Chip couldn;t sleep.
Biff had an idea.
Shw wanted to play a joke on Chip.
She had a torch in the bed.

Bff put a sheet over her head.
She switched on the torch.
The sheet glowed.
"Whooooooo! I am a ghost," said Biff.
Chip laughed
He wasn;t grightened.
He pulled the sheet off Biff.
"That was a good joke," he said.
Bff and Chip heard a noise.
It came from outside.
"Whoooo! Whoooo!" wnet the noise.
"Oh no!" said Biff.
"It's a ghost."
Chip looked out of the window.
"It's not a ghost!" he laughed.
"It's an owl. Come and look."
Bif and Chip looked outside.
"Oh no!" said Chip.
"I can see a ghost. It is a ghost this time."
Biff and Chip ran to Gra's room.
"Gran! Gran!" called Biff.
"There's a ghost outside."
But Gran wasn't in bed.
Biff and Chip ran downstairs.
"Gran!" called Biff.
"Where are you? We've seen a ghost."
But Gran wasn't downstairs.
The door opened.
Biff and Chip were frightened.
"Oh no!" they said.Gran came in.
"We were firghtned," said Chip.
"You looked like a ghost."
Gran laughed.
"I'm not a ghost," she said.
"I don't have ghosts," said Gran.
